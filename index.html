    <h2>Bhakti Link</h2>
    <p>
      Bring harmony and unity to your spiritual gatherings. Bhakti Link is a beautiful, simple app designed to solve a common problem: keeping everyone in sync during group Aartis and prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're hosting a puja for Diwali, celebrating Navratri with friends, or holding a weekly satsang, Bhakti Link ensures no one feels left out. The host easily creates a playlist of Aartis in the desired order, and guests can scan a QR code to instantly follow along on their own devices.
    </p>

    <h3>How It Works:</h3>
    <p><strong>For Hosts:</strong> Simply browse our collection of Aartis, select the ones for your ceremony, arrange them in the correct order, and generate a unique QR code.</p>
    <p><strong>For Guests:</strong> Just open the Bhakti Link app, scan the host's QR code, and immediately see the full, ordered list of Aartis for the event.</p>

    <h3>Key Features:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Create Custom Sessions: Tailor your Aarti list for any occasion.</li>
      <li>Instant QR Sharing: No sign-ups, no back-end, just a simple code to share your list.</li>
      <li>Bilingual Lyrics: Each Aarti includes lyrics with alternating lines in English and Hindi for easy reading.</li>
      <li>Modern & Simple: A clean, intuitive interface that focuses on the spiritual experience.</li>
      <li>Universal: Perfect for Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Navratri, Satyanarayan Kathas, and any family gathering.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Our mission is to use simple technology to enhance our beautiful traditions, making them more accessible and inclusive for all generations. Spend less time searching for lyrics and more time connecting in shared devotion.
